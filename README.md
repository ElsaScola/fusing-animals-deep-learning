# Fusing animals using Deep Learning
Fusing animal images using deep learning. 

## Overview
This is my proposal for the application of deep neural networks to fuse animal images. 

This project consists of two main parts: the code and a report on the project in which I explain my approach in detail.

## Dependencies
* os
* glob
